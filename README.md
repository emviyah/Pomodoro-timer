Retro Pomodoro Timer

A small productivity app inspired by old Game Boy interfaces. I built it as a way to practice Python GUI development and to make studying a bit more fun. The app includes a pixel-art avatar that the user can interact with to manage quick notes and to-dos.

What the app does

- 25-minute focus timer

- optional 5-minute break

- pause/continue for both modes

- reset timer whenever you want

- switch from break → work without resetting

- clickable avatar that opens a speech bubble for adding to-dos

- to-do list stored locally with SQLite (add + delete)

How it works:

The interface is made with Tkinter, and the to-dos are stored in a simple SQLite database.
I drew the character frames myself in a pixel art tool (Pixilart.com) and used them inside the UI.

Why I made it:

I wanted to combine a basic productivity tool with a small character interaction to make it feel a bit more personal and playful. It was also a good exercise in:

Python/Tkinter

Using SQLite for small apps

Structuring a simple GUI project

Drawing small pixel-art assets
